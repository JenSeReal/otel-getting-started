As illustrated by the previous labs, manual instrumentation of an application using the API and SDK can be a labor-intensive process.
The effort and time required to re-instrument a code base is an often deterrent to getting started.
While one factor is the financial cost, the prospect of extensive code modifications and having to learn (yet) another telemetry framework (for multiple languages) is often overwhelming to developers.
Luckily, you are reading this, so we can assume that you are open to change!
Moreover, choosing what and knowing how to instrument is often anything but trivial and can take considerable experience.
Adopting new technologies tends to be (relatively) easy green field environments.
In reality, things often get more complicated in the face of large amounts of legacy code.
One factor may simply be the volume of code that needs to be instrumented.
Another obstacle is that good instrumentation often requires understanding of the application.
However, it may be the case that the original author of a piece of code is no longer around.
In summary, even though OpenTelemetry promises to "instrument once and never again", for some, the cost will still be too high.
Recognizing these burdens, OpenTelemetryÂ tries to simplify the user experience of adoption.
For example, it is designed to integrate well with pre-existing solutions and allows for incremental migration strategies.
This section explores the mechanisms OpenTelemetry provides for producing telemetry with zero code changes.
This is where instrumentation libraries and auto-instrumentation come in.
